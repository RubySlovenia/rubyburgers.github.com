You should organize one!

- Add your city.

```
rake city NAME='Your city, Country'
```

- Edit your-city/index.markdown
- commit and PR
- Or just ask for write access to be part of the rubyburgers group (stickers included)

I stole code from openhack for this one... https://github.com/OpenHack/openhack.github.com/blob/master/Rakefile
