title: Rubyburgers - Meetup for Rubyists
---

<p class=description>
Rubyburgers is an informal meetup for rubyists. <br>
It started as a joke to help people discover great burger joints in Brussels.<br>
But the first meetup was a success with about 20 or more rubyists.<br>
Since then, it becames a monthly meeting.
</p>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>
We want more cities to organize this meetup.<br>
This is just an excue to meet and share a great moment.<br>
<strong>And it is not restricted to burgers!</strong><br>
Laurent from Rubymotion organized what he called Rubyboulets, a typical Liège meal.
